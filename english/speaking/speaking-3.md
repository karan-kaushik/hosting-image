SAMPLE ANSWER
```
The person I’m going to talk about is a friend of mine from Germany.\
I met him on Couchsurfing which is a famous app for travellers to 
(1)  make new friends. 
(2) To the best of my recollection, I was surfing the internet then he 
(3) dropped me a message to hang out with him. I was reluctant at first as I didn’t know who he was but 
(4) I had some time on my hand so I said yes.\
	My first impression about him was that he looked so young like way younger than I thought.\
	He came to Vietnam as a part of his gap year plan and it was his last destination before coming back to Germany.\
	I didn’t have much expectation but that conversation really 
(5) breathed new life into me as we found out we both love teaching.\
	He talked passionately about opening his own English center and his 
(6) aspiration to teach English for everyone. 
(7) We shared the same goal so that conversation lasted for hours  with lots of ideas showed up.\
	He also gave me sound advice to improve my English and how to teach effectively.\
	Although he is young, he talks and thinks like a 
(8) fully matured man. Unfortunately that was his last day in Vietnam so we spent every moment to enjoy 
(9) quality time together. He inspired me a lot to become a better teacher and I do hope to see him again some day

### Part 3

1.	Where can we go to meet new friends?
```
In my opinion, it depends on interest and goal of each person . People can go to the gym, make friends with ones who love 
(1) working out or join in some English clubs if they want to enhance English. 
Social networks is helpful method to find  friends from all over the world and it 
(2) narrows the gap among people. They may even  find their (3) soulmate there
	working out: to exercise in order to improve the strength or appearance of your body
	narrow the gap: reduce distance from one person to another
	soulmate: someone, usually your romantic or sexual partner, who you have a special relationship with, and who you know and love very much

2. People say that online friends aren’t true friends. Do you agree or disagree?
```
I partly agree with this. People tend to (1) make up a new version of themselves to impress others or 
(2) cover their weaknesses. That’s why once they meet in person, they’ll be upset about their e-friend. 
(3) On the one hand, it’s easier to (4) strike up a conversation when you’re hiding behind a screen. Lots of people have friends online and they 
(4) are bounded by distance but they are still nice with each other. They still keep in touch and become 
(5) lifelong friends like other relationships
	make up: to make and tell a lie.
	cover their weaknesses: hide things that are not good
	e-friend: someone you know in a digital context
	strike up a conversation: to start a conversation (with someone)
	bounded by distance: limited by distance
	lifelong friends: lasting for the whole of a person’s life
```

3. What does it mean to be a good friend?
```
I believe that 
(1) a friend in need is a friend in deed. A good friend means he’ll be a 
(2) pillar of support to his friends through thick and thin. 
(3) They  will never give up on each other and  (4) keep each other in line
	a friend in need is a friend in deed: a friend who helps you when you really need help is a true friend.
	pillar of support: A supportive or emotionally strong person
	thick and thin: you always support or stay with them, even if there are problems or difficulties
	keep each other in line: control (others or oneself) or influence skillfully
```

4. Why do people have more good friends when they study at school?
```
I think people are more (1) naïve when they are still at school. 
They don’t know how to (2)  ingratiate others and just make friends with people that make them happy.This warm relationship sets the stage for all future relationships, including friendships. 
Besides, people are (3) occupied with their work so they hardly have time to meet new friends and collegues tend to compete with each other. 
That’s why when people grow up, it’s harder for them to find true  friends
	Naïve: too willing to believe that someone is telling the truth, that people’s intentions in general are good, or that life is simple and fair.
	Ingratiate: to make someone like you by praising or trying to please them
	occupied : busy
