SAMPLE ANSWER
```
The person I’m going to talk about is a friend of mine from Germany. I met him on Couchsurfing which is a famous app for travellers to 
(1)  make new friends. 
(2) To the best of my recollection, I was surfing the internet then he 
(3) dropped me a message to hang out with him. I was reluctant at first as I didn’t know who he was but 
(4) I had some time on my hand so I said yes. My first impression about him was that he looked so young like way younger than I thought.  He came to Vietnam as a part of his gap year plan and it was his last destination before coming back to Germany .  I didn’t have much expectation but that conversation really 
(5) breathed new life into me as we found out we both love teaching. He talked passionately about opening his own English center and his 
(6) aspiration to teach English for everyone. 
(7) We shared the same goal so that conversation lasted for hours  with lots of ideas showed up. He also gave me sound advice to improve my English and how to teach effectively. Although he is young, he talks and thinks like a 
(8)fully matured man. Unfortunately that was his last day in Vietnam so we spent every moment to enjoy 
(9)quality time together. He inspired me a lot to become a better teacher and I do hope to see him again some day
